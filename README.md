# quantaSplash
A splash page using the p5js library + plain javaScript for interactive features, such as the red trail and the skewed content on scroll. This is a very simple yet striking splash page designed for a graphic design thesis project, Quanta. The first full draft of the actual website using the same interactive features can be found here: https://fernandaruiz.work/quanta
